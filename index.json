This sparsification allows to lift the communication bottleneck often present in distributed learning setups where computations are performed by workers on local data while a master machine coordinates their updates to optimize a global loss. We prove that despite its sparse asynchronous communications, our algorithm allows for a fixed stepsize and benefits from a linear convergence rate in the strongly convex case. Moreover, for $\\ell_1$-regularized problems, this algorithm identifies near-optimal sparsity patterns, so that all communications eventually become sparse. We furthermore leverage on this identification to improve our sparsification technique. We illustrate on real and synthetic data that this algorithm converges faster in terms of data exchanges.","tags":null,"title":"Weak and Strong ties","type":"page"},{"authors":["Wade Hann-Caruthers","Vadim Martynov","Omer Tamuz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"43cf26706e5f4ab17bcb0462b0bb65ae","permalink":"/publication/social-learning-speed/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/social-learning-speed/","section":"publication","summary":"In the classical herding literature, agents receive a private signal regarding a binary state of nature, and sequentially choose an action, after observing the actions of their predecessors. When the informativeness of private signals is unbounded, it is known that agents converge to the correct action and correct belief. We study how quickly convergence occurs, and show that it happens more slowly than it does when agents observe signals. However, we also show that the speed of learning from actions can be arbitrarily close to the speed of learning from signals. In particular, the expected time until the agents stop taking the wrong action can be either finite or infinite, depending on the private signal distribution. In the canonical case of Gaussian private signals we calculate the speed of convergence precisely, and show explicitly that, in this case, learning from actions is significantly slower than learning from signals.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"The speed of sequential asymptotic learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vadim Martynov"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1361145600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1361145600,"objectID":"7726c089770998778521cda77032125f","permalink":"/publication/subsidizing-lemons-for-efficient-information-aggregation/","publishdate":"2013-02-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/subsidizing-lemons-for-efficient-information-aggregation/","section":"publication","summary":"We study how social planning can reduce the inefficiencies of  social learning, stemming from herding and informational cascades.  A social planner  is introduced to the  classical sequential social learning model. She can tax or subsidize players' actions in order to maximize social welfare, a discounted sum of agents' utilities. We solve or accurately approximate the expected utility of the social planner and  the optimal pricing strategy for various signal distributions. In equilibrium,  it is optimal to increase the price for the better action, causing a reduction in current agent's utility, but also a net gain, due to the information  this action reveals. The addition of the social planner significantly improves  social welfare and the asymptotic speed of learning.","tags":null,"title":"Subsidizing Lemons for Efficient information aggregation","type":"publication"}]
